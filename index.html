        <p id="introP">Hi, I’m Matthew Schmitz, an Honours Biomedical Sciences student at the University of Waterloo.
        On this site you’ll find links to my past and ongoing projects, <a href="./resources/pdfs/MatthewSchmitzResume.pdf" target="_blank">my resume</a>, my blog articles, and a little bit about me.</p>
        <p>I am a huge fan of hip-hop, the NBA, and casual programming, but as I write this I don't know whether the content of my site will evolve to reflect that.
        I imagine my site will become somewhat of a space to share the projects I have on the go and the ones that I have completed, as well as share some of my thoughts
        and feelings on topics I find interesting. This site was coded by myself, and I intend to stick with the simple design that you see now.</p>
        <p>To provide you with a brief introduction, I am a very passionate learner who has always welcomed and embraced challenges. I have always performed well in school, and I continued
        that trend in my first year of university at the University of Waterloo where I studied Systems Design Engineering. I finished my first term in the class's 97th percentile, and proceeded
        to work at LOGiQ3 in Toronto as a Systems Developer for my first Co-op work term from January to April of 2017. I realized, however, that I was not enjoying the core engineering courses
        as much as I had expected to, and I found myself missing the science material that had so easily captured my interest in high school. For this reason, I decided to make the decision to
        switch to the Biomedical Sciences program, beginning in September of 2017. As I write this, I have not yet begun my studies in the new program, but I am looking forward to getting back
        to school in September. I cannot wait to see what opportunities arise in my new program.</p>
