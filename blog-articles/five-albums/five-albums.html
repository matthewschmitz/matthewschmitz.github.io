      <p class="dateBar italics">Published on <b>February 6, 2017</b> by <b>Matthew Schmitz</b></p>
      <p>Last week, I had the privilege of helping out with the grand opening of the innovation lab started by my co-op employer, LOGiQ3. There were several speakers who shared interesting ideas, but the thing that most astounded me was a saxophone performance by world class musician Grzech Piotrowski. He told us to close our eyes as he began building up a piece with his looping machine. The piece, called “Arctic Circle”, transported me to the cold and windy arctic. I felt the wind blowing against my face, I could hear the snow gently falling to the ground, all I could see was white. I was absolutely stunned at how his performance was able to take me, at least in my head, from the cluttered office building in downtown Toronto to the Arctic, involving all of my senses so powerfully. It reminded me of the powers of music.</p>
      <p>Music is something that can trigger such intense mental and emotional responses, in part due to its connection to our nostalgic brains (for more on this watch this amazing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0x7ho_IYc" target="_blank">VSauce episode</a>). It can evoke feelings of sheer happiness or despair, excitement or anxiety, hope or fear, and the magnificent thing about it is that the response it triggers is different for every person. As much as our thoughts and feelings can influence our taste in music, the music we listen to can influence our thoughts and feelings.</p>
      <p>I have learned so much from music. I have become a better person, a smarter person, and a more thoughtful person through listening to music, so, inspired by Grzech Piotrowski’s performance, here are 5 albums that have had a significant impact on me in the past couple of years:</p>

      <h2>To Pimp A Butterfly - Kendrick Lamar</h2>
      <p><b>Overview:</b> The third studio album by my favourite artist, Kendrick Lamar, takes a critical look at the state of America, exploring various avenues of turmoil and conflict, like discrimination, capitalism, gang activities, and the everyone-for-themselves attitude that he says plagues the nation.</p>
      <p><b>What I love about it:</b> I love the way that Kendrick’s message, told through seamless rhyming over smooth and jazzy instrumentals and a continually developing poem, is expressed in such a memorable way.</p>
      <p><b>My favourite songs:</b> These Walls, Momma, How Much a Dollar Cost, The Blacker the Berry</p>
      <p><b>What it means to me:</b> This album inspired me to want to do good in the world. It sounds cliché, but the impact that this album had on me was so powerful, that it still, to this day, urges me to take action for the good of others every time I listen to it. It reminded me that the most important thing in the world is to have love for one another, be respectful, and be accepting of all people.</p>
      <p><b>Memorable quote:</b> “I know if I’m generous at heart, I don’t need recognition”</p>

      <h2>1999 - Joey Bada$$</h2>
      <p><b>Overview:</b> 1999 was released when Joey Bada$$ was only 17 years old, and it was quickly recognized as one of the best mixtapes of 2012. It features a collection of East coast style tracks filled with incredible wordplay and great passion.</p>
      <p><b>What I love about it:</b> Some of the bars in this mixtape still blow me away. Joey uses such complex rhyme schemes and displays an extraordinary vocabulary. I just… wow.</p>
      <p><b>My favourite songs:</b> SURVIVAL TACTICS, Hardknock, World Domination</p>
      <p><b>What it means to me:</b> Whenever I listen to this album, I feel a rush of creativity and adrenaline. And the bars are delivered with such confidence that it usually rubs off on me and gives me a feeling of empowerment and excitement to accomplish my goals.</p>
      <p><b>Memorable quote:</b> “But it’s far from over / Won’t stop til I meet Hova and my momma’s in a Rover”</p>

      <h2>2014 Forest Hills Drive – J. Cole</h2>
      <p><b>Overview:</b> The J. Cole album famous for going double platinum with no features explains Cole’s experience growing up wanting fame and fortune, only to have his dreams materialize and discover that what all of those things fail to deliver is happiness.</p>
      <p><b>What I love about it:</b> Cole’s message that family, friends, and love are the only things that can truly bring happiness is universal, and one that all of us forget from time to time as we feel motivated by materialistic things.</p>
      <p><b>My favourite songs:</b> 03’ Adolescence, Hello, Love Yourz</p>
      <p><b>What it means to me:</b> This album reminds me to appreciate all those around me, and be thankful for the friends and family with whom I share mutual love. It reminds me that even on the worst days, I can always find comfort in the love and support surrounding me in my life.</p>
      <p><b>Memorable quote:</b> “But you ain’t never gon’ be happy til you love yourz”</p>

      <h2>Blonde - Frank Ocean</h2>
      <p><b>Overview:</b> Frank Ocean’s long (and I mean LONG) awaited project finally arrived in August of 2016, and it presents a string of beautiful vocal performances by Frank to achieve a very intimate sound.</p>
      <p><b>What I love about it:</b> The way that Frank is able to deliver a very emotional record by using, quite often, subtle instrumentals and carrying many of the tracks with a strong vocal performance. This allows his song writing ability to be showcased, and his natural talent to be out on full display.</p>
      <p><b>My favourite songs:</b> Ivy, Self Control, White Ferrari</p>
      <p><b>What it means to me:</b> This album always reminds me of the importance of being connected to your emotions. I find that sometimes with work and school I fall into a routine and lose touch with my emotional side, so to speak, but this album reminds me that it’s good to be happy sometimes, just as it’s not a bad thing sometimes as well to be sad and reflect on your feelings. I truly believe that introspection is one of the most important things we can do, and I think that Frank’s ability to connect to and channel his emotions helped to teach me how to do the same.</p>
      <p><b>Memorable quote:</b> “I’m sure we’re taller in another dimension / You say we’re smaller and not worth the mention”</p>

      <h2>The College Dropout - Kanye West</h2>
      <p><b>Overview:</b> The first studio album by Kanye West, the superstar who is oftentimes only portrayed by the media as an egotistical jerk, came from a more thoughtful and, for lack of a better term, low-key point in his life, before his superstardom had launched him into the A-list. It explores, through a very societally conscious lens, several rather deep topics that many “new-Kanye” fans may not be accustomed to hearing from him, like prejudice, religion, materialism, and personal struggles.</p>
      <p><b>What I love about it:</b> Looking at Kanye’s career, his evolution as an artist has been so clearly segmented, as he seemingly brought an entirely new style to every album he has released to date. My favourite of which is the style employed on The College Dropout. It fascinates me that this album, full of thoughtful lyrics and important messages, was written by the same Kanye West who released Yeezus, an ego-driven self-reaffirmation in the format of a 10 track album (this isn’t to say that I don’t like new Kanye West music as well, because I do. I just want to emphasize the wide spectrum of material he has released).</p>
      <p><b>My favourite songs:</b> We Don’t Care, Never Let Me Down, Slow Jamz</p>
      <p><b>What it means to me:</b> This album is important to me not only because of the meaningful subject matter of many of the tracks, but also because it, although indirectly, reminds me of the importance of staying humble. Just like many others, including Kanye himself <a href="https://genius.com/Kanye-west-i-love-kanye-lyrics" target="_blank">(see here)</a>, I miss the “old Kanye”. Kanye West has developed as a character throughout his many years in the public eye, going from thoughtful, shy, Chicago kid to loud, obnoxious, self-centred A-list celebrity, as his confidence transitioned into arrogance. I am reminded when I listen to this album that, no matter how much fame and acclaim you may have, it is important to stay humble and respectful.</p>
      <p><b>Memorable quote:</b> “It seems we living the American dream / The people highest up got the lowest self-esteem / The prettiest people do the ugliest things / For the road to riches and diamond rings”</p>
      <br />
      <p class="italics">Just as Ralph Waldo Emerson famously said of books, I cannot remember every word of every song I have ever listened to; even so, they have made me.</p>
