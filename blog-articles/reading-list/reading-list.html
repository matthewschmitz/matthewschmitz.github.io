      <p class="dateBar italics">Updated on <b>April 2, 2018</b> by <b>Matthew Schmitz</b></p>
      <p>This page contains a running list of books that I have read in 2018. Following each title is a quick rundown of my general thoughts on the book.</p>

      <p class="bookTitle"><span class="italicsBold">Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!</span> &nbsp; by Richard Feynman</p>
      <p class="bookDescription">I really enjoyed reading about the many interesting and quirky stories that Feynman had accumulated over the years. Although I disagreed with some of his ideas and attitudes, this book was nevertheless very hard to put down, as Feynman's unique outlook on life never ceases to entertain. One story that sticks out to me is the story of how he trained ants to take an elevator for food (read the book).</p>

      <p class="bookTitle"><span class="italicsBold">Fahrenheit 451</span> &nbsp; by Ray Bradbury</p>
      <p class="bookDescription">There is a reason that this book is considered to be a classic. The story is so haunting, but the book is so elegantly written. I can't give this book enough praise. If you haven't read it yet, read it!</p>

      <p class="bookTitle"><span class="italicsBold">Astrophysics for People in a Hurry</span> &nbsp; by Neil DeGrasse Tyson</p>
      <p class="bookDescription">Neil DeGrasse Tyson is one of the modern superheroes of scientific communication. He is able to convey information in such a way that he is able to satisfy both the scientific mind and the layperson. He covers a wide variety of fundamental concepts in great detail, and I really enjoyed this book from start to finish. It is worth warning you that it is hard not to read this book with Neil DeGrasse Tyson's voice narrating in your head.</p>

      <p class="bookTitle"><span class="italicsBold">Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind</span> &nbsp; by Yuval Noah Harari</p>
      <p class="bookDescription">This book captured my interest from the very first page. It reads like a storybook, detailing the major revolutions that humankind has undergone, like the agricultural and scientific revolutions, explaining how each once has helped to shape our species into what it is today.</p>

      <p class="bookTitle"><span class="italicsBold">Unraveling Oliver</span> &nbsp; by Liz Nugent</p>
      <p class="bookDescription">This book wove together the stories of countless characters in uncovering, piece by piece, the story of an equally charming and repulsive antagonist. I could not put this book down, reading the whole thing in one sitting.</p>

      <p class="bookTitle"><span class="italicsBold">Seven Brief Lessons on Physics</span> &nbsp; by Carlo Rovelli</p>
      <p class="bookDescription">Exactly as the title suggests, this book walks through seven (very) brief lessons on physics. The lessons are meant to provide a high level overview of some fundamental concepts of modern physics in very simple language. The book is very approachable regardless of your scientific background, and being less than 100 pages it is not too difficult to read in one or two sittings.</p>

      <p class="bookTitle"><span class="italicsBold">Turtles All The Way Down</span> &nbsp; by John Green</p>
      <p class="bookDescription">This book was incredibly enjoyable, and it shines much needed light onto the harsh reality that is living with mental illness. I will admit that his teenage characters do often carry out some pretty sophisticated philosophical conversations, but this didn't interfere with my enjoyment of the book and John Green's writing style. At its core this book is an easy read with colourful characters and an engaging plot. I would definitely recommend this book.</p>

      <p class="bookTitle"><span class="italicsBold">Michael Jordan: The Life</span> &nbsp; by Roland Lazenby</p>
      <p class="bookDescription">Ongoing... Thoughts to come...</p>
