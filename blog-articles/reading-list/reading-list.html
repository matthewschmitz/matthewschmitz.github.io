      <p class="dateBar italics">Updated on <b>April 2, 2018</b> by <b>Matthew Schmitz</b></p>
      <p>This page contains a running list of books that I have read in 2018. Following each title is a quick rundown of my general thoughts on the book.</p>

      <p class="bookTitle"><span class="italicsBold">Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!</span> &nbsp; by Richard Feynman</p>
      <p class="bookDescription">I really enjoyed reading about the many interesting and quirky stories that Feynman had accumulated over the years. Although I disagreed with some of his ideas and attitudes, this book was nevertheless very hard to put down, as Feynman's unique outlook on life never ceases to entertain. One story that sticks out to me is the story of how he trained ants to take an elevator for food (read the book).</p>

      <p class="bookTitle"><span class="italicsBold">Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind</span> &nbsp; by Yuval Noah Harari</p>
      <p class="bookDescription">This book captured my interest from the very first page. It reads like a storybook, detailing the major revolutions that humankind has undergone, like the agricultural and scientific revolutions, explaining how each once has helped to shape our species into what it is today.</p>
